Upon The Death Of Francesco, Castruccio Became The Governor And Tutor Of Pagolo, Which Increased Enormously His Power And Position, And Created A Certain Amount Of Envy Against Him In Lucca In Place Of The Former Universal Goodwill, For Many Men Suspected Him Of Harbouring Tyrannical Intentions. Among These The Leading Man Was Giorgio Degli Opizi, The Head Of The Guelph Party. This Man Hoped After The Death Of Messer Francesco To Become The Chief Man In Lucca, But It Seemed To Him That Castruccio, With The Great Abilities Which He Already Showed, And Holding The Position Of Governor, Deprived Him Of His Opportunity; Therefore He Began To Sow Those Seeds Which Should Rob Castruccio Of His Eminence. Castruccio At First Treated This With Scorn, But Afterwards He Grew Alarmed, Thinking That Messer Giorgio Might Be Able To Bring Him Into Disgrace With The Deputy Of King Ruberto Of Naples And Have Him Driven Out Of Lucca.</h3></div> </div>
