Upon The Death Of Francesco, Castruccio Became The Governor And Tutor Of Pagolo, Which Increased Enormously His Power And Position, And Created A Certain Amount Of Envy Against Him In Lucca In Place Of The Former Universal Goodwill, For Many Men Suspected Him Of Harbouring Tyrannical Intentions.

Castruccio At First Treated This With Scorn, But Afterwards He Grew Alarmed, Thinking That Messer Giorgio Might Be Able To Bring Him Into Disgrace With The Deputy Of King Ruberto Of Naples And Have Him Driven Out Of Lucca.</a> <span class=\"flex\">294</span> </li>",
